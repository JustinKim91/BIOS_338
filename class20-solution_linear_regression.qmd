## Working with mtcars data

Using the readily available mtcars dataset, we will follow this to [guide](https://modernstatisticswithr.com/regression.html#linearmodels) our understanding of linear regressions.

Reference : [modern statistics with R textbook/chapter 8.1](https://modernstatisticswithr.com/regression.html#linearmodels)

Setup, loading package and data

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars <- mtcars
```

Look at the two columns of interest in a plot quickly

```{r quick-visualize}
plt_1 <- 
  {ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point()} %>% 
  print
```

Graph shows that higher horsepowered cars (`hp`) consume more fuel and have less fuel efficiency (miles per gallon / `mpg`)

# Correlation

Check the correlation between `hp` and `mpg`

```{r corr}
with(data = mtcars,
  cor(x = hp, y = mpg))
```

Negative value implies as x increases, y decreases ***linearly***

## Spearman's Rank correlation

Rank = 1,2,3,4.. rank of the values after ordering them. This is a non-parametric technique (*doesn't involve fitting to distributions)*, and it throws away data magnitudes retaining only their order.

This tells us approximately if the ranks of x and corresponding y match up well

-   +1 = perfect match of ranks of x and y

-   -1 = order is inverted but perfect match

-   0 = order of y is totally jumbled up compared to x =\> their relationship is `not monotonic`

```{r rank-corr}
with(data = mtcars,
  cor(x = hp, y = mpg, method = 'spearman'))
```

The rank only correlation is higher absolute valued, which means the data definitely has a decreasing relationship but is probably not very *linear!*

# Linear regression

Now let's try to fit a linear regression

```{r lin-reg}

# do linear regression
m <- lm(formula = mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)

m # quick overview
```

This implies that the equation to fit the two vectors is

$mpg = 30 - 0.7 * hp + noise$

```{r summ-linreg}
summary(m) # shows more analysis than just print(m)
```

## Detailed diagnostics of fit

What to look for in these plots?

-   This [section](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggResidpanel/vignettes/introduction.html) should be helpful for general interpretation of these plots, *made with a better pacakge:* **Diagnostic Panels with `resid_panel`**

```{r plot-lm}

plot(m)
```

# Explore Anscomsbe's quartet

Explore the fitting between y1 \~ x1 .. y1 \~ x4

```{r ascombe-quartet}

anscombe <- datasets::anscombe
```

```{r anssombe-explore}

ggplot(anscombe, aes(x2, y2)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```
